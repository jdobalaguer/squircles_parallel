########################################## Method
Details of the way in which the study was conducted (how you did it).

Should include the standard sections:
-participants,
-materials and apparatus,
-experimental design,
-procedure
plus others as appropriate to your particular experiment (for instance, you may wish to include a section describing the various psychometric tests that you used, or the arrangements for referral of hospitalised patients, etc).
The balance between these sections depends on the particular project area. It is very important that you give enough detail to enable future workers to replicate your study exactly and to state any assumptions that you make, for instance in selecting or matching participants, or in devising an experimental procedure. Full details of your apparatus should be available to your reader, but rather than disrupt the 'flow' of your prose, it may be preferable to put these in an Appendix if lengthy. Note: Putting a questionnaire in the Appendix does not substitute for a thorough description of that questionnaire -- including rating scales, anchors, number of items -- in this section.

########################################## Results
Presentation of the results of your analyses (what you found).

A description of, and 'guided tour' around, what you found, with a minimum of interpretation (leave this for the Discussion section). A good principle to follow is that you begin with your most important/interesting results. Do not burden your reader with raw data (put these in an Appendix), but give summary tables where appropriate. If you include tablesor figures, you must refer to them in the text of this section (e.g., see Table 1). Remember that some people find pictorial representations (e.g., histograms, graphs etc) easier to understand than numbers (â€œa picture is worth a thousand words . . . and you only have 6,000!). Many people use figures to help highlight what they consider to be their most important results. Explain why you have chosen your statistical tests, and give a summary of what they reveal (detailed working or computer printouts go in an Appendix). It is a good idea to finish this section with a sentence summarizing your results.
